  <a href="{{ "/about/" | prepend: site.baseurl }}"><p>Robots with Hearts is a blog about technology & society. Itâ€™s a
  space for art and non-art: poetry, fiction, essays, and visual art. Some of the work here focuses only on technology
  or society, but a lot of it interrogates how they relate. Most of it is my own, but I also commission and accept
  work from others.</p></a>
