      <p>Robots with Hearts is a blog about technology & society. Itâ€™s a space for art and non-art: poetry, fiction,
      essays, and visual art. Some of the work here focuses only on technology or society, but a lot of it interrogates
      how they relate. Most of it is my own, but I also commission and accept work from others.</p>
