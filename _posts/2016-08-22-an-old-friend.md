An Old Friend
===

*Isaac Hollander McCreery, 22 August 2016*

For a long time, I've called *Robots with Hearts* "a space for art and non-art: poetry, fiction, essays, and visual art."  It's never had any visual art, though.  One of the goals I set for myself when I left Google was to pick up the pen and brush again.  It's been too long.
