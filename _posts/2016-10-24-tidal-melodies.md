Tidal melodies
---

*Isaac Hollander McCreery, 24 October 2016*

The tidal melodies fill this room,  
Vibrations of air become currents  
That lift my body, once heavy, now light  
Out of the brackish depths.

My chest a buoy, back arched, like when  
You kissed me last night and I writhed,  
But now I'm here, now still, now soft,  
These sounds soaking steady into me.

Lift me out, lift me out, after this long, dark drowning,  
Your light touch is enough to pull me.  
The saline of the chords: they shine transparent  
And silvery in the light of the morning.

Wake me, take me, make me anew  
Pull me up, out of this darker place.  
Breathe new life into me, sweet music,  
Pull me out of these underwater caves.
