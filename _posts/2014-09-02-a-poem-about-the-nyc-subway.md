A Poem About the NYC Subway
===

*Isaac Hollander McCreery, 2 September 2014*

I'm on the New York subway, and there's a preacher with short, stormy hair, sitting on the steps down to the platform.
He's scrawling lines from his bible down in a notepad.  It's early Sunday morning.

I guess we all struggle to find time for God.
