I Burn Hotter Than I Used To
===

*Isaac Hollander McCreery, 26 June 2016*

I could spend lifetimes  
Wading,  
Sinking,  
Breathing  
Into the coolness of the lake  
Because  
I burn hotter than I used to.

The little waves,  
Rolling,  
At my feet  
Flitting dragons on the border  
Between the heights of what I see  
And the depths of what is possible.

I live here now,  
A furnace of anger and hope.  
No longer clear glass,  
I cannot be shattered.  
I am molten; I radiate  
Heat  
And light.
