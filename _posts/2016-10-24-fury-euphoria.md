Fury/Euphoria
---

*Isaac Hollander McCreery 24 October 2016*

The sinews in my chest  
Whine and pluck  
As my diaphragm  
Lunges down, forward, and out under my ribcage,  
And my heart spins faster and then  
Starts to hover.

I can't bear to  
Look you in the eye, it's just  
Too much in this moment  
I see ochres and ceruleans and  
I feel a sudden draft of air bend my scalp.

I look down to avert your gaze.

My shoulder blades part slightly,  
Lift me up,  
Seraph's wings.  
I am taller than I was before,  
Then

My chest explodes.  
Bright sparks singe my chin and my thumbs  
As I look down and  
Reach forward,  
I see a gaping hole in  
The shirt I donned this morning,  
Burnt, black and brown around the edges,  
And a small flame still gasping for breath.

This is all.  
This is enough.
