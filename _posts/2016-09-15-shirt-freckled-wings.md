Shirt / Freckled Wings
===

*Isaac Hollander McCreery, 15 September 2016*

This shirt falls  
Over my body, I can  
Feel its lightness, warm and dry.

When you look at me,  
What do you see?  
A boy?  A young man?  
Do you see yourself?  
(You know it’s obvious, but we can’t choose how we’re made.)  
Someone to  
Touch, to hold, to  
Cry with or cry on or cry about?

Life’s an eternal hand of bridge, hearts stacked  
Ace-high, but  
Short, and this  
Shirt sure shocks  
Deep, wide neck:  
Look at my chest—  
Look at it!  
Do you see a  
Beating heart or a  
Misused shred of cotton?

This shirt is a cloud on a cloudless day—  
Only thing around that’s whiter than I am.  
See, I’ve got freckles, a couple on my  
Breast (you’ve seen) and more on my wings.

Because with this piece of cloth,  
(Woven, interminable,  
Undeniably topologically equivalent to your dress, whatever)  
I fly!
