Adventure
===

*Isaac Hollander McCreery, 12 August 2016*

I want to go on an adventure today,  
Far-out and fast  
Past the moon, around the sun,  
And past the speed of light.

I want to wear your clothes today,  
To feel a different way.  
I might get killed.  
But I have to believe I won’t  
Because fear is the little-death.

Fact is that fast is  
Really what’s important  
Because there’s plenty of adventure close by  
Around the block  
Through alleys  
Past dumpsters that sing wisdom.

FUCKS

SHED IT

LOVE HARD

Love hard, that’s it!  
With my backpack as my captain  
And my books as my only battalion  
Loving hard is what’s important.  
Today is a day  
To love hard.
