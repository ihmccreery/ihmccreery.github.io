Three Poems in February
---

*Isaac Hollander McCreery, 19-26 February, 2017*

## Passing Thoughts While Waiting in Line to Use the Restroom

"By trade, I'm a software engineer,"

What do people think of me when I say that?  
Bro.  
Gentrifier, colonizer.  
Privileged, disconnected.  
Greedy, a social climber.  
A happy, oblivious member of the New Aristocracy.

How is it that I've  
Come to love a craft  
That's so entwined  
In what's so fucked up  
About our world and how people  
Dominate each other?

I am a mason, an devout atheist building  
Cathedrals for the papacy.  
I am a humble shipwright, a pacifist building  
Boats for the wars of the world.

## Everything Swirls

Everything swirls.  
Everything.

My head and my sinuses feel like they're in  
A blender.  
My head and my heart feel like they're  
Inside out—  
How did I get here?  
Always the question—  
How did I get here?  
My head and the tale I tell myself are  
All mixed up, one  
Trying to catch the other, but I'm  
Not sure which is which.

## The March of March

"Your joy is your sorrow unmasked," said the prophet.  
"And the selfsame well from which your laughter rises was oftentimes filled with your tears."

Your August is your February unmasked.  
The magic of barbecues and music on the grass, giddy  
Dancing and laughter:  
What are they but  
Freedom from the grey and chill?

And Californians don't really know  
What love looks like.

Because we hold each other closer when  
We have nothing but coffee and  
Good friends keeping us  
From going over the edge.
