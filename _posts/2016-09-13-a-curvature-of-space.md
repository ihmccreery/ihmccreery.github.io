A Curvature of Space
===

*Isaac Hollander McCreery, 13 September 2016*

Wake up again, the same sized  
Hole between chest and arms  
A perfect curvature of space  
Down and around  
Rib cage and waist and  
Curling up and through  
Shoulder and neck.

A place where  
Once there were—and  
Soon there will be—  
Arms locked.

But not now.
