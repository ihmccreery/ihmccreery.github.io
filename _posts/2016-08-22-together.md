Together
===

*Isaac Hollander McCreery, 22 August 2016*

Last night I saw the Dark Cavalry approaching,  
Riding fast with swords drawn.

Then I found myself riding with them,  
Side-by-side, brothers in arms:  
Separation on my left,  
And Death on my right.

Together we inflicted  
Writhing and torturous pain.
