Everlasting
---

*Isaac Hollander McCreery, 2 November 2016*

Say goodbye to the days,  
To the dry,  
To the warmth,  
To the apple tides.

We may as well wear  
Wet wool socks  
Damp dawn to  
Dark dusk.

Smoke begins to enter our lungs,  
And sparks to dance in our eyes.  
Whisky hesitantly licks our tongues,  
And love cradles our hibernating hearts.

The clouds gently awaken, turn over, and sigh.

The season of everlasting  
Nighttime is upon  
Us.
