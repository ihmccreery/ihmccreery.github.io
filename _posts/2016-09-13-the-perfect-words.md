The Perfect Words (Daily Practice)
===

*Isaac Hollander McCreery, 13 September 2016*

I used to think  
I ought to find  
The perfect words

So you knew  
Once and always  
That I loved you

And that would be enough

Now, though, I  
See its form  
Love is a body  
It requires constant care, the  
Daily practice of  
Shaping and reshaping  
I love you

Not of perfecting  
But of growing  
Forever.
