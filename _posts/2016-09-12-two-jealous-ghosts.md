Two Jealous Ghosts
===

*Isaac Hollander McCreery, 12 September 2016*

Two jealous ghosts will  
Curl up on a porch swing.  Autumn will have  
Guided our skin back into its clothing cocoons, will have  
Encouraged us with a hand at our backs:

“Go  
Go, wrap yourselves in wools and silks, it’s  
No the time for bareness.”

But we will  
Replace our cold clothes with  
Shrouds of darkness.  We'll  
Slip under the night and  
Slip off our silks, share  
Time, share  
Space, share  
Sense.

Autumn will pursue us  
Three months through, but we will  
Always outrun her.  
We always have, right?

It’s my love of the chase that greets me with eagerness, I know we  
Hug tighter and  
Glow brighter  
When she’s just around the bend.
