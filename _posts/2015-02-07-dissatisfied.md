Dissatisfied
===

*Isaac Hollander McCreery, 7 February 2015*

I want friends who will cry with me  
And with whom I can cry;  
Who will come with me to confront Lord Death  
And all his handsom brothers.

I want friends who will push drugs on me  
Love, alcohol, ambition, coffee ...  
Then {whisk} them away from me  
With tenderness and compassion.

Because life and love are simple, really:  
They are full, that's all.

Won't you come cry with me?  
I want to see tears on your face, and feel tears on mine.  
Won't you come tear me from my clothes?  
I want to feel your skin, and see my skin reflected on yours.
