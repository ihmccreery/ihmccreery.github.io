Stage Four
===

*Isaac Hollander McCreery, 16 September 2016*

*Somehow it's already been a year*  
*You keep finding new ways to make yourself reappear*  
*I hope you never leave me be*  

Time keeps a quick clip.  You'll  
Try  
To keep pace but  
Your body,  
Despite you,  
Despite all of us, will fall  
Further and further  
Behind.

Some day your body will cave in:  
You’ll trip.  And  
You won’t  
Get up.  
Time will turn,  
Twist his ribcage and look back.  
He’ll watch the glow in your eyes  
Extinguish.  
He’ll consider you there, but  
He won’t consider stopping.  
He’ll continue on.

*It’s all yours—*  
*It’s yours—*  
*I’m all yours—*  
*I’m yours—*  
Because you ask all of me, and I  
Keep you in my heart as best I can, but

Some day your body will cave in:  
You’ll trip.  And  
You won’t  
Get up.  
I will turn,  
Twist my ribcage and look back.  
I’ll watch the glow in your eyes  
Extinguish.  
I’ll consider you there, and  
I know I'll consider stopping,  
Though I know you wouldn’t want me to.

Time will continue,  
And so will I walk beside  
Him, and we’ll leave you  
Behind.
