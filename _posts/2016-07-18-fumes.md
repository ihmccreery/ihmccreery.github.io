Fumes
===

*Isaac Hollander McCreery, 13 July 2016*

Fumes,  
Noxious, sour fumes,  
Clouds of bitter and angry earth,  
Undead flowers, blooming into the sky.

I sucked them up,  
Drank them, breathed them,  
Daily bathed and nightly slept in them.

I coughed, choked,  
The brades of deaths past wrapped around me,  
Strip searched me, and  
Left me cut and bleeding.

I vomited.  

And then,  
With the acrid taste in my mouth,  
I looked  
Up.

My eyes watered and the skin under my young beard burned.  
But through the saline and shivers,  
Though the shatters and shocks of shells,  
I swear to you, on all the clack and rattle of death I've ever heard,  
That for a brief moment,  
Before I wavered and fell,  
I saw the sun.
