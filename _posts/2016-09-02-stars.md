Stars
===

*Isaac Hollander McCreery, 2 September 2016

“Alone, disentangled:  
Is that what you want?”

He asked me again as we swung to and fro in the breeze,  
Coating our bare skin in the smells and tastes of early September.

I am a girl, one among thousands,  
A start strewn billions of years ago into the Milky Way.  
I stare forever  
At you,  
At all of you,  
Until, one day,  
I’ll burn out.

“No, but I want to be free.”

You may turn your gaze upon me—  
I hope you would—  
But you can never engulf me,  
For I am too big.

Breath out—  
Do you hear that?  
It’s your own breath, not mine,  
And it will always be your own breath, not mine,  
Until it ceases completely.
