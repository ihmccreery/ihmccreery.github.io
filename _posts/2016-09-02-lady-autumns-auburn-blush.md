Lady Autumn’s Auburn Blush
===

*Isaac Hollander McCreery, 2 September 2016*

I’m surprised at the comfort you bring to me.  
When I first slept beside you, it felt pleasant:  
Sisters.

I don’t expect I’ll ever see you again, dear,  
But I find no discomfort in that.  
You helped bring Autumn on,  
A new rhythm that starts  
After the long, long stream of consciousness,  
Summer.  
She never pauses for breath, never,  
And I get picked up,  
Carried,  
Spun around and laid  
Down  
With her.

Thank you for bringing the rain,  
I needed it.

Sunshine is the rain unmasked,  
But as the night draws closer still,  
Summer’s sunny skin must cede  
To Lady Autumn’s auburn blush.

A farewell to you feels like a farewell to summer,  
The end of a time, a sweet, tender time.
