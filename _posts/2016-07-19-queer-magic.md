Queer Magic
===

*Isaac Hollander McCreery, 19 July 2016*

Often  
I look back  
And feel  
That all the growing  
Iâ€™ve ever done  
Has been the work of  
A queer person or  
A woman or  
A person of color.

You,  
With love, shall  
Force me  
To see myself as I am,  
To cease fleeing from reality  
And begin to change it.
